Potato crops are one of the most widely cultivated and economically significant food sources across the world. However, they are highly vulnerable to a range of fungal infections, particularly Early Blight and Late Blight, which can rapidly spread across fields and cause severe yield losses if not identified in time. 
Traditional disease detection methods rely heavily on manual inspection by experts, which is often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.
To address these challenges, this project leverages deep learning techniques to automatically classify potato leaf diseases from image data. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of potato leaf images, the system can accurately distinguish between healthy leaves and those affected by common diseases.
